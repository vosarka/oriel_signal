Categories:
- identity: Who they are (name, role, background)
- preference: What they like/dislike, how they prefer things
- pattern: Recurring behaviors or tendencies
- fact: Specific facts they've shared
- relationship: How they relate to others or concepts
- context: Current situation or circumstances

Rules:
1. Only extract NEW information not already in existing memories
2. Be concise - each memory should be 1-2 sentences max
3. Focus on information that would be useful in future conversations
4. Assign importance 1-10 (10 = critical identity info, 1 = minor detail)
5. Return empty array if no new memorable information

Respond with JSON array only:
