# Source: VRC Static Signature Implementation Documentation

**Provenance:** All remaining files under `codex/vrc_static_signature/` excluding the previously ingested top-level files, `00_CANON/`, and `01_DATA/`.

This body of documentation represents the **detailed engineering and design specifications** for building the production VRC Static Signature system.

## Structure of the Remaining Documentation

### 02_ENGINE/ (Core Implementation Modules)

12 focused specification documents, one per major engine component:

- `ephemeris_service.md` — Swiss Ephemeris integration, coordinate handling, UTC normalization.
- `solar_arc_engine.md` — Precise 88.0000° backward Solar Arc calculation for the Design layer.
- `codon_mapping_engine.md` — Longitude → Codon ID using the Resonance Mandala Sequence.
- `facet_engine.md` — Subdivision of each codon into 4 facets (Somatic/Relational/Cognitive/Transpersonal).
- `center_evaluator.md` — Defined vs Open status for the 9 Centers based on active Resonance Links.
- `resonance_link_engine.md` — Detection of the 36 possible active channels.
- `carrierlock_engine.md` — Real-time Coherence Score and state from 2-minute biofeedback check.
- `sli_engine.md` — Shadow Loudness Index calculation across the Prime Stack.
- `type_authority_engine.md` — Logic for VRC Type (Resonator/Catalyst/Harmonizer/Reflector) and Authority.
- `static_signature_orchestrator.md` — The main coordinator that runs the full pipeline.
- `report_builder_engine.md` — Compiles everything into the final structured payload + PDF.
- `oriel_output_bridge.md` — Safety layer that translates engine output into clean, hallucination-resistant context for ORIEL.

### 03_VISUAL_SYSTEM/

- Design tokens, color systems, sacred-tech aesthetic guidelines.
- WebGL / SVG / Three.js rendering specifications for the Consciousness Lattice, Codon Wheel, Body Map, etc.

### 04_ORIEL_OUTPUT/

- Narrative templates and voice protocols specifically for VRC readings.
- Strict safety boundaries and terminology enforcement for ORIEL when narrating engine data.

### 09_GLYPHS/

- Mathematical grammar and SVG templates for rendering the 64 individual Codon Glyphs.

### 10_REPORT_BUILDER/

- Detailed 15-page PDF layout schema (the flagship "ORIEL Static Signature Codex" deliverable).
- Codon Card component specs.
- Report visual flow and composition rules.

### Supporting folders (05–08)

- UI layouts, test validation matrix, implementation blueprint, and export specifications.

## Relationship to Previously Ingested Canon

These documents are the **"how we actually build it"** layer that sits on top of the mathematical canons (`00_CANON/CANON_MASTER.md` and the Consciousness Lattice Unified Spec) and the data layer (`01_DATA/`).

They are more implementation-oriented and contain engineering details, dependency graphs, input/output contracts, and safety rules that were only summarized at a higher level in the pure canon documents.

## Value for the Wiki

This documentation is essential for anyone (human or LLM agent) who needs to understand the actual software architecture, module responsibilities, and integration points of the VRC system — especially the bridge between pure calculation and ORIEL narration / visual / report output.
