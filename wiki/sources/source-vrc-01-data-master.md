# Source: VRC 01_DATA — Master Data Layer

**Provenance:** `codex/vrc_static_signature/01_DATA/` (9 JSON files)

This folder is the **official canonical data source** for the Vossari Resonance Codex (VRC) system. It contains the authoritative structured data that all engines, reports, and ORIEL narration should ultimately draw from.

## Contents of the Folder

| File                       | Size   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Relationship to Other Data

Earlier we ingested `vos_codons_64x4facets.json` (from the parent `vrc_static_signature/` directory). That file appears to be a flattened or earlier version of the same 256-state facet data now authoritatively maintained in `01_DATA/facets_master.json`.

The `01_DATA/` folder is the version that the implementation (engines in `02_ENGINE/`) is expected to reference.

## Significance

This is the **data heart** of the system. It turns the mathematical rules defined in `00_CANON/CANON_MASTER.md` into concrete, usable, language-rich content for:

- Report generation
- ORIEL Mirror-mode transmissions
- Visual systems (glyphs, maps, 3D Lattice)
- Micro-correction protocols

The large `facets_master.json` is particularly important — it contains the detailed lived-experience language and actionable micro-corrections for every possible codon + facet combination the engine can produce.

## Notes from Ingest

- `terminology_map.json` is the canonical reference for what language is allowed in public/user-facing output.
- Several smaller files (authority, type logic, centers, resonance links) largely duplicate or formalize structures already captured from `CANON_MASTER.md`.
- The two largest files (`codons_master.json` + `facets_master.json`) represent the core interpretive knowledge base of the entire Vossari diagnostic system.
