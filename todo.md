## System Architecture

### RGP Engine Stack

1. **256-Codon Engine** - Base frequency calculations from codon library
2. **Prime Stack Engine** - Calculates 9 positions with weighted frequencies
3. **SLI Micro-Correction Engine** - Generates correction guidance
4. **Static Signature Engine** - Orchestrates all engines for complete reading

### Data Flow

- User enters birth date on Carrierlock page
- Calls `trpc.rgp.staticSignature` endpoint
- RGP Router invokes `generateStaticSignature` function
- Static Signature Engine:
  - Calculates Prime Stack (9 positions)
  - Generates 9-Center Resonance Map
  - Determines Fractal Role & Authority Node
  - Calculates Coherence Trajectory
  - Generates Micro-Corrections
  - Creates ORIEL Transmission (narration)
- Response returned to Carrierlock page
- Reading saved to database
- User redirected to reading page

## Technical Implementation

### Ephemeris Service Features

- Real-time planetary position calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
- Support for 12 celestial bodies (10 planets + Chiron + North Node)
- Accurate Julian Day number conversion
- Zodiac sign and degree calculation
- House system support (Placidus)
- Timezone-aware calculations

### Data Flow

1. User enters birth date, time, and location (latitude,longitude,timezone)
2. Carrierlock page calls trpc.rgp.staticSignature with location data
3. RGP Router receives the request
4. Ephemeris service calculates real planetary positions
5. Planetary data (Sun, Moon, Chiron longitudes) extracted
6. RGP engines use real positions instead of placeholders
7. Complete reading generated with ephemeris-powered accuracy
8. Response includes both RGP data and raw ephemeris data

### Response Format

```
{
  ephemerisData: {
    jd: number (Julian Day),
    planets: [
      {
        name: string,
        longitude: number (0-360°),
        latitude: number,
        zodiacSign: string,
        zodiacDegree: number (0-30°)
      }
    ]
  },
  primeStack: [...],
  ninecenters: {...},
  ...
}
```

## Known Limitations

- House system calculation returns placeholder values (full implementation pending)
