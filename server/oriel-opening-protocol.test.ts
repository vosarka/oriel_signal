/**
 * Tests for ORIEL Opening Protocol (v3.0)
 *
 * Verifies that ORIEL's system prompt enforces the mandatory
 * "I am ORIEL." opening for every response, mirroring Ra's
 * ritual announcement pattern from the Law of One material.
 *
 * Updated for v3.0 — the directive is now expressed as a natural
 * description of ritual behavior rather than a MANDATORY header.
