# Vossari Conduit Hub - Development Log

## Recent Implementations

### 1. File Upload Support for ORIEL Chat

- **PDF & DOCX Integration:** Upgraded the ORIEL chat interface to allow users to upload PDF and DOCX files (up to 2 files, 50MB limit per file).
- **Server-Side Parsing:** Added a new backend service (`server/file-parser.ts`) using `pdf-parse` and `mammoth` libraries to extract text flawlessly from binary files.
- **Base64 Transmission:** Modified the frontend and backend strictly to use Base64 encoding for file transfers, ensuring stability and preventing context truncation errors.

### 2. Signal Path Journey Architecture

We redesigned the site's flow to create an intuitive four-stage initiation path for new users:

- **Navigation Restructuring:** The navigation bar was completely reordered and renamed to reflect the journey:
  - `HOME`
  - `ARTIFACTS`
  - `PROTOCOL`
  - `CODONS` (formerly "Codex")
  - `CALIBRATION` (formerly "Readings")
  - `CHANNEL ORIEL` (formerly "Conduit/Interface")
  - _Note: "Begin the Signal Path" button was deliberately removed from the global navigation to emphasize its importance on the Home page._

- **Home Page Hero Redesign:**
  - Updated headline to: **"The Resonance Circle"**
  - Added subtitle: _"Have you decoded your Resonance Codons?"_
  - Replaced the "Enter the Archive" CTA with **"BEGIN YOUR SIGNAL PATH"**, which routes directly to the `/carrierlock` assessment page.

- **"Static Signature Scan" (`/carrierlock`):**
  - Renamed the starting assessment tool from "Resonance Diagnostic" to **"Begin the Signal Path" / "Static Signature Scan"**.
  - Updated descriptive text to clarify that a Static Signature reveals the baseline resonance pattern derived from birth data.

- **Post-Reading Flow (`/reading/static/...`):**
  - Added a "Signal Detected" completion block at the bottom of the Static Reading result page.
  - Included a prompt explaining that while Static Codons are permanent, current state determines their expression.
  - Provided direct Action buttons: **"Explore the Codons"** or **"Run Dynamic Calibration"** (which links back to the Carrierlock slider assessment).

- **Calibration History Page (`/readings`):**
  - Renamed "Reading History" to **"Signal Calibration History"** to align with the new nomenclature.

### 3. Authentication Routing Fixed

- Corrected the `getLoginUrl()` function in `const.ts`. Previously, accessing the login page on a local/dev environment would 404 by directing to an unconfigured Manus server. It now correctly falls back to the app's internal `/auth` page.

## Planned Next Steps (The Roadmap)

### 1. Stage Three: Dialogue with the Signal (ORIEL Integration)

- Ensure the user's recent readings (Static and Dynamic) automatically contextualize their conversations with ORIEL in the "CHANNEL ORIEL" interface.
- Make the Living Orb visualization pulsate specifically in response to the generated text/audio output (as previously discussed using audio-visualization concepts).

### 2. User Dashboard & Profile Polish

- Integrate a visually compelling summary of the user's latest Coherence Score and Dominant Codons on their `/profile` page.
- Allow users to export or mint their 'Static Signature' as a shareable Artifact.

### 3. "Decode Your Resonance" Enhancements

- Fine-tune the logic and UI animations within the Dynamic Calibration section (the Carrierlock sliders for Mental Noise, Body Tension, Emotional Turbulence) to make the feedback loop feel more "alive" and responsive.

### 4. General UX/UI

- Further refine the immersive visual effects (blur backgrounds, hover animations, responsive mobile menu overlays).
- Fix any remaining type or lint errors introduced during the rapid integration of libraries (e.g., verifying `@types/pdf-parse` scope in CI/CD).

## Feature Backlog (Future Phases)

### 5. Resonance Mirror

- **Echo Mirrors** — users with similar codon patterns (feel immediately recognized)
- **Complement Mirrors** — users whose codons complete the user's pattern (collaboration dynamic)
- **Catalyst Mirrors** — users whose codons activate shadow growth (discomfort = evolution)
- Viral invite mechanism: _"Your signal is incomplete alone. Find your Mirrors."_ → user sends friend a link; friend must do reading to see compatibility
- Combined codon field display: "Resonance Bridge" showing paired patterns + system interpretation

### 6. Community Field Stats Page

- Live counters: Receivers Activated, Most Active Codon Today, Average Coherence Score
- Participatory layer — people see they are part of something growing
- Drives return visits and social proof

### 7. 7-Day Codon Evolution Ritual

- Turn micro-corrections into a structured daily practice system
- Shadow → Gift → Siddhi progression arc per codon
- Daily check-in mechanic to keep users returning
- "Activate Evolution Mode" CTA from reading result page

### 8. Receiver Notes (Per-Codon Community Comments)

- Short user observations attached to each codon page in the Codex
- Examples: "RC01 hits me hardest when I have too many ideas at once." / "The kinetic discharge trick actually works."
- Transforms the Codex from information into a living archive of shared human experience

### 9. Daily Signal / Today's Resonance Climate

- System-generated daily dominant codon field (e.g., "Today favors innovation, disruption, and new patterns.")
- Personalised daily signal update per user's codons
- Homepage widget or dedicated section

### 10. Field Visualization (Galaxy Map)

- Visual network of all receivers rendered as a galaxy
- Color = dominant codon, lines = resonance links between users
- Users can explore it — literally a living neural network of the field
