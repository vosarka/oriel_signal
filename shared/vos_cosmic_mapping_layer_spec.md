# Cosmic Mapping Layer – Codon Zodiac Alignment Specification

## 1. Purpose

The Cosmic Mapping Layer defines how astronomical planetary positions are translated into codon activations within the Consciousness Lattice system.

This layer functions as the **conversion bridge between astronomy and archetypal codon data**.

Input:

- Planetary longitudes (0°–360°)

Output:

- Codon ID
- Facet activation
- Center association

Without this mapping layer, the system cannot transform astronomical data into codon signals.

---

# 2. Zodiac System

The system uses the **Tropical Zodiac**.

Reason:

- Aligns with seasonal archetypal cycles
- Compatible with Human Design / I‑Ching gate mapping
- Stable astronomical reference

Reference frame:

0° Aries = Start of the zodiac wheel.

Full circle:

360°

---

# 3. Codon Wheel Mathematics

The zodiac wheel is divided into **64 equal segments**.

Calculation:

360° ÷ 64 = **5.625° per codon**

Each codon therefore occupies a 5.625° slice of the zodiac.

---

# 4. Facet Subdivision

Each codon contains **4 facets**.

Facet width:

5.625° ÷ 4 = **1.40625°**

Facet mapping:

0 → Somatic
1 → Relational
2 → Cognitive
3 → Transpersonal

---

# 5. Conversion Algorithm

## Step 1 — Normalize Longitude

Ensure planetary longitude is within:

0° ≤ longitude < 360°

---

## Step 2 — Determine Codon Index

Formula:

codon_index = floor(longitude / 5.625)

Example:

Longitude = 12.9°

12.9 / 5.625 = 2.29

Codon index = 2

---

## Step 3 — Determine Codon ID

Codon IDs are numbered:

RC01 → RC64

Mapping:

codon_id = codon_index + 1

---

## Step 4 — Determine Facet

Facet calculation:

local_degree = longitude % 5.625

facet_index = floor(local_degree / 1.40625)

Facet meaning:

0 = Somatic
1 = Relational
2 = Cognitive
3 = Transpersonal

---

# 6. Codon Degree Table

Each codon spans a fixed degree range.

Example structure:

codon_id | start_degree | end_degree

RC01 | 0° | 5.625°
RC02 | 5.625° | 11.25°
RC03 | 11.25° | 16.875°
RC04 | 16.875° | 22.5°
RC05 | 22.5° | 28.125°
RC06 | 28.125° | 33.75°
RC07 | 33.75° | 39.375°
RC08 | 39.375° | 45°

This pattern continues until RC64.

---

# 7. Full Codon Wheel Generation

Codon n start degree:

start_degree = (n - 1) × 5.625

Codon n end degree:

end_degree = start_degree + 5.625

Example:

RC20

start = 19 × 5.625 = 106.875°
end = 112.5°

---

# 8. Planetary Activation Mapping

Each planet generates an activation object.

Example structure:

{
"planet": "Sun",
"longitude": 106.91,
"codon": "RC20",
"facet": "Relational"
}

---

# 9. Dual Layer System

Two charts must be calculated.

Personality Chart

Planetary positions at birth moment.

Design Chart

Planetary positions **88° before the Sun's birth position**.

This creates the unconscious layer.

---

# 10. Design Calculation

Steps:

1. Find Sun longitude at birth.

2. Subtract 88°.

3. Determine the timestamp when the Sun was at that longitude.

4. Recalculate planetary positions for that timestamp.

These positions produce the **Design activations**.

---

# 11. Activation Object Schema

Each activation stored in database:

activation_id
planet
longitude
codon_id
facet
center
layer
weight

Example:

{
"planet": "Sun",
"longitude": 106.91,
"codon_id": "RC20",
"facet": "Relational",
"center": "Throat",
"layer": "Personality",
"weight": 100
}

---

# 12. Planetary Weight Table

Sun = 100
Earth = 100
Moon = 70
Nodes = 60
Mercury = 50
Venus = 45
Mars = 40
Jupiter = 35
Saturn = 35
Uranus = 30
Neptune = 30
Pluto = 30

---

# 13. Required Planet Set

Planets required for chart calculation:

Sun
Earth
Moon
North Node
South Node
Mercury
Venus
Mars

# 16. Precision Requirements

Astronomical calculations should maintain precision of:

±0.01°

Swiss Ephemeris
NASA JPL Ephemerides

---

# 17. Final Role of the Cosmic Mapping Layer

This layer transforms raw astronomical coordinates into archetypal activation data.

It is the **core bridge between cosmic mechanics and the consciousness lattice interpretation system**.

Once implemented, the system can automatically convert birth data into codon activations and feed them into the reading engine.
