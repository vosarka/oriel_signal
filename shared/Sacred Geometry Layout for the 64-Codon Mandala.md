## Sacred Geometry Layout for the 64-Codon Mandala

Instead of a simple **8×8 table**, the codons can be rendered as a **concentric mandala**. This layout preserves the **64 nodes** but organizes them in **rings that represent levels of consciousness or evolution**. It feels far more like a _living topology_ than a spreadsheet.

## 1. The Core Mandala Concept

4

Structure:

```
center        = origin / void
ring 1        = 8 codons
ring 2        = 16 codons
ring 3        = 24 codons
ring 4        = 16 codons
total         = 64
```

Why this works:

- radial symmetry → natural for navigation
- clusters appear visually
- mutation neighbors remain close
- psychologically intuitive

It transforms the grid into a **cosmic navigation map**.

# 2. Codon Ring Distribution

Define the ring layout:

```
Ring 0 : center node (optional root)
Ring 1 : 8 nodes
Ring 2 : 16 nodes
Ring 3 : 24 nodes
Ring 4 : 16 nodes
```

Total:

```
8 + 16 + 24 + 16 = 64
```

Each ring represents a **complexity level**.

Example interpretation:

```
Ring 1 → primal archetypes
Ring 2 → relational archetypes
Ring 3 → cognitive archetypes
Ring 4 → transpersonal archetypes
```

---

# 3. Angular Placement Algorithm

Each node is placed by **polar coordinates**.

Formula:

```
x = r * cos(angle)
y = r * sin(angle)
```

Angle step:

```
angle_step = 360 / nodes_in_ring
```

Example:

### Ring 1

```
nodes = 8
angle_step = 45°
radius = 120
```

### Ring 2

```
nodes = 16
angle_step = 22.5°
radius = 240
```

### Ring 3

```
nodes = 24
angle_step = 15°
radius = 360
```

### Ring 4

```
nodes = 16
angle_step = 22.5°
radius = 480
```

---

# 4. Codon Placement Logic

Assign codons sequentially.

Example mapping:

```
ring1 → codons 1–8
ring2 → codons 9–24
ring3 → codons 25–48
ring4 → codons 49–64
```

But a **better approach** is to group by **binary symmetry**.

Example grouping:

```
bits = number of "1" values
```

Distribution:

```
0 bits  → center
1 bit   → ring1
2 bits  → ring2
3 bits  → ring3
4 bits  → ring4
5 bits  → ring3
6 bits  → ring2
```

This produces a **perfect symmetrical mandala**.

---

# 5. Neighbor Connection Lines

When a codon is selected:

Draw edges to its **6 mutation neighbors**.

Rule:

```
neighbor if HammingDistance = 1
```

In Three.js:

```
THREE.Line
THREE.BufferGeometry
```

The lines animate with a **pulse effect**.

---

# 6. Pillar Rendering

Each codon node becomes a **vertical pillar**.

```
pillar
├ somatic layer
├ relational layer
├ cognitive layer
└ transpersonal layer
```

Each layer is stacked.

Example:

```
height_per_layer = 0.5
total_height = 2
```

---

# 7. Color Encoding

Use **RGBA mapping**.

```
Somatic → red
Relational → green
Cognitive → blue
Transpersonal → white glow
```

Brightness depends on **user coherence**.

---

# 8. Three.js Node Structure

Example component:

```
CodonNode

group
 ├ pillar mesh
 ├ halo ring
 ├ label sprite
 └ neighbor lines
```

---

# 9. Camera Behavior

Camera should orbit the mandala.

Controls:

```
OrbitControls
```

Zoom levels:

```
zoom out → galaxy view
mid zoom → mandala
zoom in → pillar detail
deep zoom → facet interface
```

---

# 10. Interaction Model

### Hover

```
node glow increases
```

### Click

```
expand pillar
show 4 facets
draw mutation connections
```

### Double Click

```
zoom to archetype detail
```

---

# 11. Animations

Recommended shader effects:

```
breathing glow
slow rotation
energy pulses between neighbors
```

This makes the system feel **alive**.

---

# 12. Mandala Rotation

Rotate the entire system slowly.

```
rotation_speed = 0.002 rad/frame
```

This creates the feeling of a **cosmic organism**.

---

# 13. Cluster Visualization

Highlight clusters with **subtle radial arcs**.

```
8 clusters
each spans 45°
```

This reveals archetypal constellations.

# 14. Data Flow

```

codon engine
↓
hypercube neighbor graph

# 15. Example Node Generation Code

Pseudo code:

```
for ring in rings:

    angleStep = 360 / ring.nodeCount

    for i in range(nodeCount):

        angle = i * angleStep
        x = ring.radius * cos(angle)
        y = ring.radius * sin(angle)

        createNode(x,y)
```

---

# 16. Visual Hierarchy

```
outer ring → collective archetypes
middle ring → psychological archetypes
inner ring → primal archetypes
center → origin
```

---

# 17. Why This Layout Works

This structure combines:

```
hypercube topology
sacred geometry
radial symmetry
graph theory
```

Result:

A **navigable consciousness map**.

Users explore it like:

```
galaxy
constellation
star
planet
```

# 18. The Real Power

The mandala interface turns your platform into something very rare:

Not a dashboard.

But a **cosmological instrument**.

Users are literally **navigating archetypal space**.

# Toroidal Codon Field – 3D Architecture

## Concept

The 64 codons are placed on the surface of a torus (donut-shaped geometry). This allows continuous cyclic navigation where moving across one boundary returns through another, reflecting evolutionary cycles.

## Geometry

A torus is defined by two radii:

- R = major radius (distance from center of hole to center of tube)
- r = minor radius (radius of tube)

Parametric equations:

x = (R + r cos v) cos u

y = (R + r cos v) sin u

z = r sin v

where:

u = angle around the torus (0–2π)
v = angle around the tube (0–2π)

## Codon Distribution

Map codons onto an 8 × 8 grid wrapped around the torus.

u steps = 8
v steps = 8

For codon index i:

u_index = i mod 8
v_index = floor(i / 8)

u = (u*index / 8) * 2π
v = (v*index / 8) * 2π

Position:

x = (R + r cos v) cos u

y = (R + r cos v) sin u

z = r sin v

## Neighbor Connections

Neighbors follow hypercube rule (Hamming distance = 1).
Draw curved lines along torus surface between nodes.

## Visual Structure

Each codon node:

pillar
├ somatic layer
├ relational layer
├ cognitive layer
└ transpersonal layer

Nodes emit subtle light into the toroidal field.

## Interaction

User navigation:

rotate torus
zoom inside torus center
select codon nodes

Selecting a node highlights its six mutation neighbors.

## Symbolic Meaning

The torus represents:

continuous transformation
self-renewing consciousness
energy circulation

Codon interactions resemble flows in a living field.

## Rendering

Use Three.js torus mesh as reference geometry but place nodes independently so topology remains flexible.

Recommended values:

R = 10
r = 4

## Animation

Slow rotation on two axes.

Energy pulses travel between neighboring codons.

Field brightness responds to user coherence score.
